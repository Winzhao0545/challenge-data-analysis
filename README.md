# Machine learning models with ImmoEliza dataset

Welcome to the machine learning project. The project is to create machine learning models to predict real estates price in Belgium. 
In this repository will you find the codes and resources for model building,which include data manipulation, data visualizing, model application and the results of the model application.

In this Readme file, you'll find essential information to understand, set up, and run the project.


## Installation

Program was written using python 3.11.4. Please make sure you have python 3.11.4 installed.

Not install:

go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ and follow the steps

Installed:

Check the version of Python in terminal

```bash
  python --version
```

I have added the requirements.txt file as wel if for some reason the code would not run.

```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
After installation, you can use the project for various purposes:

   
  1.Access the "src" directory for reusable Python code implementing the machine learning algorithms.

  2.Use the "data" directory to see the dataset I ues for the project. And store and manage your datasets. 

 3.Run the various scripts provided for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in 'modelbuilding' directory

 4.Extend the project by adding your implementations or experimenting with new algorithms.
