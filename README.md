Create machine learning model with ImmoEliza dataset

Welcome to the machine learning project. This repository contains the code and resources for data manipulation, data visualizing, model application and results of the model application.

I do this project because I would help ImmoEliza to predict the future immo price in belgium.

In this Readme file, you'll find essential information to understand, set up, and run the project.
  
- Installation

Program was written using python 3.11.4. Please make sure you have python 3.11.4 installed. have added the requirements.txt file as wel if for some reason the code would not run.
 

- Libaries used

pandas - data manipulation

matplotlib and seaborn - datavisualization

sklearn - data formating and model applying

 - Usage 

After installation, you can use the project for various purposes:

  1.Access the "src" directory for reusable Python code implementing the machine   learning algorithms.
     
  2.Use the "data" directory to see the dataset I ues for the project. And store and manage your datasets. 
  
  3.Run the various scripts provided for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in 'modelbuilding' directory
  
  4.Extend the project by adding your implementations or experimenting with new algorithms.
