 data analysis for immoeliza
In this project, I will explain the immodata in Belgium.

I use library 'pandas' to manupulate the data and 'seaborn' and 'matplotlib' to visualize the data
 
First, you will see a graph of percentage of missing value. The graph helps you to see the values that miss more. So I only keep the categories of data that are sufficient to explain the immo situation in Belgium.

Second, you will see the immodata regarding to different region, province and municipalities. For example, the ratio of number of properties in different region, price level of property in different locations and property type and the most and less expensive municipalities in different region

Finally, you will see the correlation between number of rooms and price, and between living area and price, which help you to understand what character affect the price.
